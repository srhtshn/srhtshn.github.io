Hello there,  
I am Serhat, a software developer.

After graduating from the university with a BSc. degree from Computer Engineering programme, I've started developing iOS applications, due to my interest in Apple ecosystem and its products.

Over the years, I have always been a consumer of the information. This time, I decided to share my learnings online. This blog will help me keeping my notes organized and I hope It will also be helpful for those who are reading.

I attemped to have a personal blog couple of times, but couldn't manage to keep it active. Hopefully, this time outcome will be different.

Cheers!
